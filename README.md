# OC_Projet_3
# "Public Health France" agency has issued a call for projects to find innovative application ideas related to nutrition.
We plan to participate and propose an application idea.

# The Data
Excerpt from the call for projects:

The Open Food Facts dataset is available on the official website. The variables are defined at this address.

The fields are divided into four sections:

## General information about the product sheet: name, date of modification, etc.
## A set of tags: product category, location, origin, etc.
## The ingredients that make up the products and any additives.
## Nutritional information: quantity in grams of a nutrient for 100 grams of the product.

# Mission
After reading the call for projects, here are the different steps you have identified:

 Process the dataset by:

Thinking of an application idea.
Identifying relevant variables for upcoming treatments, necessary for your application idea.
Cleaning the data by:
highlighting possible missing values, with at least 3 methods of treatment adapted to the variables concerned,
identifying and quantifying any aberrant values of each variable.
Automating these treatments to avoid repeating these operations.
The program must work if the database is slightly modified (e.g., addition of entries).
Throughout the analysis, produce visualizations to better understand the data. Perform a univariate analysis for each interesting variable, to synthesize its behavior.

The call for projects specifies that the analysis must be easy to understand for a lay audience. Therefore, be attentive to readability: text size, color choices, sufficient clarity, and vary the graphics (box plots, histograms, pie charts, scatter plots, etc.) to best illustrate your point.

Confirm or refute hypotheses using multivariate analysis. Perform appropriate statistical tests to verify the significance of the results.

Justify your application idea. Identify arguments justifying the feasibility (or not) of the application based on the Open Food Facts data.

Write an exploration report and pitch your idea during the project defense.
